# Death Rates from COVID-19 vs Spanish Flu 

The purpose of these exercises was to compare the Spanish Flu of 1918-1919 to the current COVID-19 pandemic. 

Over 50 million people worldwide died from the Spanish flu. US deaths totalled 675,000. As of 2/10/21, total US deaths from COVID-19 are 465,000.

Using great data found online from the British Ministry of Health and comparing it to current data, I made the following plots using Excel and Jupyter notebooks:

* I found death rates from the Spanish flu in the major American cities of the day and compared that data to death rates from COVID death rates in the same cities. The Spanish flu in the US was much deadlier than COVID has been so far.
* Similarly, I compared deaths in the major American cities of 1918 to current deaths from COVID-19 in the same cities. Total Spanish flu deaths in the cities were 142,631, compared to 65,846 from COVID.
* I compared the timeline of deaths from the Spanish flu in America to the timeline of deaths from COVID in America.

In the plot, I compared death rates/1000 people in the ten major American cities of 1918 (I also included Nashville). As shown, the Spanish flu in the US, was much deadlier than COVID has been so far. 

A couple of interesting discoveries:
* Many experts believed the Spanish flu arrived on ships carrying military troops from Europe and spread in closed barracks, and that “the disease must to some extent be spread by infected drinking vessels.”
* Interestingly, San Francisco enforced mask-wearing as an experiment to ward off the disease. Like today, it was controversial. Christian Scientists and “business men” rose in opposition to the idea. Nevertheless, 90% of the citizens wore them during October, 2018.
